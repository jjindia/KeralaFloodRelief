# Open Source Project - Kerala Flood Relief - Analytics

I'm collecting the data from various sources and creating a slideshow to display the analytics & Predictions (approx) towards Kerala Flood Relief which I believe will help in knowing the amount of distribution of resources like foods, man-power, etc

You can make your own contribution here by creating issues & pull requests

Thank you
